# Force Transducer
These are the files I have made working on a force transducer for Dr. Vincent Chen at Loyola Chicago. The 3030 version is the most up to date, as it is more structurally sound. The 2020 version is included for reference if anyone needs it. Files are available in STL for slicing and printing, sldprt for myself (since it's done with the maker version of solidworks), and STEP for others to edit.
